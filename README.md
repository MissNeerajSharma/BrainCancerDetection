# 🧠 AI-Powered Brain CT Scan Tumor Detection

A deep learning–based Flask web application to detect and classify brain tumors from CT scans into four categories:
- **Glioma**
- **Meningioma**
- **Pituitary**
- **No Tumor**

This project leverages **VGG16**, a pre-trained CNN model trained on over 14 million images, and fine-tuned using a private, doctor-annotated dataset. The system assists radiologists and doctors in early and accurate brain tumor diagnosis.

## 🚀 Demo

🧪 Try uploading a brain CT image and get predictions in real time.  
The model returns the **tumor type** and **prediction confidence score**.
